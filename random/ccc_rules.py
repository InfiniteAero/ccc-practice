General Rules
Implementation Details
All input is from standard input and all output is to standard output. Submitted pro-
grams must not read or write to ﬁles.
Output must match the output format speciﬁed in the problem exactly. Prompts or
additional output must not be produced.
Unless stated otherwise, programs will be evaluated with a 3 second time limit and a
512 MB memory limit.
Submissions
We will accept up to 50 submissions per problem. Students may submit at most once
per minute to any particular problem.
Feedback
Feedback is always provided for the sample test cases. For each subtask of a problem, if
all test cases are correct, this feedback is provided for each test case. Otherwise, feedback
is provided for all test cases up to and including the ﬁrst test case that is not correct.
More speciﬁcally, when feedback is provided for a test case, one of the following results
is reported.
 correct (e.g., your output matches the expected output exactly)
 compilation error (e.g., your program did not compile)
 time-limit exceeded (e.g., your program took too long to ﬁnd an answer)
 run-time error (e.g., segmentation fault in your program)
 wrong answer (e.g., your program gave incorrect output)
Contest Scoring
We will take the maximum score over all submissions for each problem as the student
score for that problem.
We will take the maximum score between the Junior and Senior contest as the student’s
overall score.
Note that while it is possible for students to write both contests, the contest timer will
begin when the student starts either the Junior or Senior contest: students will have a
maximum of 3 hours in total to submit solutions to either contest.
Use of the Internet, References and Other Tools
During the contest, students may use the internet for editing code, code compilation,
contest submission, and consulting oﬃcial programming language documentation.
Examples of allowed programming language documentation include:
http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/
https://docs.python.org/2/reference/index.html
https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html
https://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-c-manual/gnu-c-manual.html
https://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/ref/ref.html
All other Internet use (email, chat, Google search, code forums, etc.) is forbidden.
Any editors or integrated development environments (IDEs) can be used to code solu-
tions. This includes online editors and online compilation tools.
Access to other source or starter code is not allowed during the competition. This includes
both electronic and printed source code, either created by the contestant or gathered else-
where.
Most calculators are permitted. See http://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/calculators.
html for more information.
Students are allowed to use rough paper, graph paper, rulers and compasses.
Students may use paper dictionaries for translation between English and another lan-
guage. Students may not use electronic translation devices.
Use of forbidden tools or sources, or collaboration with other students during the contest
will result in severe penalties:
 the student will receive a score of 0 on the CCC;
 their school will be notiﬁed;
 the student will be banned from all future CCC contests.
Internet connections, server loads and other features of online systems are inherently
unpredictable. Therefore, since we are only able to accept submissions successfully re-
ceived through the CCC Grader within the 3-hour time limit, there is some risk when
submissions are made near the end of the contest.
